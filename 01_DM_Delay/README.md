# 📩 DM Delay Button App

**Day 01 of 30 - 30-Day Dev Streak 🚀**

A React + TypeScript app that mimics the "Undo Send" feature found in messaging platforms. When a user clicks **Send**, the message is delayed by a few seconds — giving them the option to **cancel** before it's officially sent.

## 📌 Features

- ⏱️ Delay sending messages by 10s / 30s / 60s
- ❌ Cancel sending within the delay window
- 📤 Toast notification when the message is successfully sent
- 👁️ Optional preview before final send
- 🎨 Clean UI with **Tailwind CSS** + **ShadCN UI**
- 📁 Component-based folder structure (`components/`, `pages/`)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- `setTimeout()` and `clearTimeout()` for managing delayed execution
- Managing UI state using React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Implementing conditional rendering (toggle Send/Cancel)
- Organizing React projects into maintainable folder structures
- Applying real-world UX logic — “Undo” functionality
- Using **ShadCN UI** for reusable, accessible components

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/))
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **ShadCN UI** (built on Radix)
- Toast notifications (via ShadCN/toaster)
